Jamie grew up in Cornwall, New York, where they graduated from high school in three years, started the school's first [GSA](https://www.glsen.org/participate/student-action/gsa), and won a national gold medal and scholarship from the [Scholastic Art & Writing Awards](http://www.artandwriting.org) and the [National Constitution Center](https://constitutioncenter.org). On their gap year, they worked in New York City as an administrative assistant and TA at [Writopia Lab](http://www.writopialab.org), where they'd been an early workshop participant. Jamie then went to Hampshire College in Amherst, MA where they graduated with a BA in storytelling. Their thesis project was creating and being the dramaturg for a documentary theater piece about if and how people learn about sex from television. While at Hampshire, Jamie co-facilitated and coordinated a performance project for non-theater students to tell the stories of their bodies.

During college, Jamie worked at [North Star](http://www.northstarteens.org/#learningisnatural), a self-directed learning center for teens, where they tutored and taught writing, TV history, and theater in addition to co-facilitating an LGBTQ+ group. They also volunteered with the [See-Hear-Feel-Film media literacy program](http://amherstcinema.org/education/about-see-hear-feel-film) at [Amherst Cinema](http://amherstcinema.org). They interned with the [Entertainment Media team](http://www.glaad.org/entertainment) at [GLAAD](http://www.glaad.org) and the [It Gets Better Project](http://www.itgetsbetter.org) in Los Angeles and with the [New York Neo-Futurists](http://www.nyneofuturists.org) in New York. One summer, they field managed teams of canvassers for [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org) in Boston (yes, they got yelled at a lot). They ran social media for and later produced the podcast [Sex For Smart People* (*that means you)](http://sexforsmartpeople.com) during its final year and a half with the extraordinary [Orion Stephanie Johnstone](http://orionjohnstone.com). 

Jamie participated in [The Homecoming Project](http://oralhistory.columbia.edu) in 2016 and later served on the scholarship committee at [Live Out Loud](https://www.liveoutloud.info). In 2016, they received a grant from the [Awesome Foundation San Francisco](http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/sf), which allowed them to begin work on [Will](https://transembassy.com/will/). From 2016-2017, Jamie was an ambassador for the University of Wisconsin's [Depression in Young Adults module](http://healthexperiencesusa.org/depression). From 2016-2018, Jamie was the administrative coordinator for INCITE (a social science research center) and OHMA (and Oral History Master's program) at Columbia University.

In 2018, Jamie will be in residence at the Santa Fe Art Institute's Truth & Reconciliation Residency and at Wildacres Retreat. You can see more about their community work [here](https://transembassy.com).

Most significantly, Jamie is a big old nerd. They love pirates and space travel and their 2000 Honda Civic, Mildred. You can find them reading tarot cards, walking over the Queensboro Bridge, or trying to convince people to watch their favorite shows. They are based in Queens, New York.

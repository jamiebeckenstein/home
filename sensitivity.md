## What is Sensitivity Reading?

Sensitivity reading is when an expert in an underrepresented experience reviews a text and makes suggestions about how to make it more inclusive and accurate. This can include suggestions about language use and phrasing, how to make ideas accessible to multiple populations, and how to make sure that content about people with certain identities is not just about but for them. Sensitivity reading is increasingly popular in publishing, but is beginning to spread to other industries. It is similar to consulting, but exclusively for text.

## About me

Hi! I’m Jamie Beckenstein. I’m a sensitivity reader and consultant specializing in trans issues. My expertise on the trans community comes from being a part of it (specifically, I am transsexual, genderqueer, and a trans man) in addition to working extensively within it (you can read more about my work with trans communities [here](https://transembassy.com)). Additionally, I have a BA in dramaturgy from Hampshire College with a specialization in TV.

I love doing education work around trans experiences. I pass no judgements on what previous knowledge you may or may not have-- you’re taking a wonderful step by finding out if sensitivity reading is right for you! I will work gently and directly with you to make sure that your work is the most inclusive it can be and that you’ll have a new understanding of how to move forward using that knowledge. 

I do sensitivity reading on TV and film scripts, plays, non-fiction articles, short stories, website copy, presentations/ workshops, and academic writing. I consult on workshops, group events, presentations, facilitation, etc..

You can learn more about me and other work I’ve done [here](/index).  

## PRICING

## How I Read Tarot

Basically, you email me a question, and I use a tarot reading to help you explore it! I see tarot as a way to bring a new lens to an experience and/or emotion that you may be having. I believe that tarot works equally well if you, like me, believe that magic brings the cards that are needed to the top of the deck or if you, like many of my loved ones, believe that it’s random (or if you believe anything else!). 

Questions can be almost anything, but work best if they’re seeking a new way to engage with something and/or clarification on an emotion or circumstance. You’re welcome to give me as much or as little background on the circumstances surrounding your question as you’d like.

I do not do predictive readings, i.e. readings that tell you what will or won’t happen in the future. I also don’t read about how other people feel about you (i.e. I won’t read about if someone has a crush on you, but I would read about how you might engage with your feelings about the potential of their crush on you). 

When you email your question, please note what services you’d like and [how much you’ll be paying for them](#pricing) You can send payment via PayPal (jamiebeckenstein [AT] gmail.com) or Venmo [@james0ctober]. I will send a written reading within a week of receiving payment, or respond within 48 hours to start the process of setting a date and time to meet for an in-person reading.

It is important to note that I am not a trained mental health professional. 

## Specialties

I am deeply invested in the power of narrative and storytelling, and really understand what it means to love a TV show or movie or book or character; I welcome questions about relating to stories. I also particularly love doing readings about upcoming projects or events. While I generally operate from an identity/ oppression-informed perspective, I am specifically adept at reading about transness and queerness. All this said, I read on any topic you’d like! 


## Offerings

WRITTEN READINGS: A written tarot reading based on a question that you ask. I’ll write individually about each card in the reading and how some of the cards relate to one another all through the lens of your question. I will also send a picture of the spread itself. Reading will be sent out within a week of payment being received unless otherwise noted. Sent as a PDF unless you request otherwise. 

IN PERSON* READINGS: A tarot reading based on a question that you ask. I’ll talk individually about each card in the reading and how some of the cards relate to one another all through the lens of your question.

GROUP READINGS: I read for individuals in a group context (i.e. offices, teams, families, etc.) about a single theme, for groups as a collective on a single question, or for people individually at a designated table at an event. 

VIDEO READINGS: Like an in-person reading, just on Skype or FaceTime or Gchat.

UNANNOTATED PLAYLIST: A playlist based on the cards pulled in your reading and their interactions. Will be shared via Spotify.

ANNOTATED PLAYLIST: The playlist above including annotations on why each song was chosen, relevant lines, and other media recommendations. Will be shared via Spotify and PDF.

*I do not have a home base until June 1, 2019, and will be all over the US-- please email to see if/ when I will be in your area.

## Pricing ##

WRITTEN, IN PERSON, AND VIDEO READINGS: Sliding scale, $30*-$90. 

GROUP READINGS: Dependent on the situation. Please email with details (location, style of meeting or event, if you’d like me to read for individuals in a group, a group as a whole, or individuals alone) and I will respond with a price (and/or questions). 

UNANNOTATED PLAYLIST: Sliding scale, $10*-$30

ANNOTATED PLAYLIST: Sliding scale, $20*-$40

*If the low end of the sliding scale is not possible, please be in touch anyway! We can work by barter (I am particularly interested in trading for Spanish lessons or ASL lessons, but am very open to other ideas).

A NOTE ON THE SLIDING SCALE: I offer readings on a sliding scale because I practice a community-oriented tarot and deeply believe that it is a healing practice that should be accessible to everyone. That said, this is not a casual gig for me, it’s how I make my money for rent and food. If you are able to pay on the upper end of the scale, please do. It supports me in being able to do trans community work, which you can learn more about [here](https://transembassy.com).

## Testimonials

“The first time I had a tarot session with Jamie, they did a three-card reading for me. I was new to tarot, so I appreciated that they patiently explained to me the format of the reading, why it was structured that way, and how I could engage with the topics we covered. They were warm and calm, guiding me through each step of the reading and discussing what they saw in the cards in clear and accessible language….Jamie offers myriad pathways to help [a group] relate to the cards and their messages— the artistic elements of the images on the cards, pop culture references, their own relationship to the cards, how the card is commonly interpreted, and questions the card might be prompting you to ask yourself. **They offer their interpretations without judgement**, checking in with you every step of the way to see if we understand or have questions. 

A tarot reading session with Jamie is as much about the way you react and relate to the interpretation as it is about their interpretation itself. Their goal in reading is not to predict your future, but to offer insights as to how we can reflect on and relate to our lives— how to engage with a difficult moment, or prepare for new challenges, or rethink our relationships….**I always leave a reading with them feeling more centered and more hopeful**— and their readings have often been catalysts for new perspectives and important decisions in my life.” -C.W.

“Jamie's respect for both the craft of Tarot and the querent's individual experience can help anyone connect to the cards in a way that's meaningful and empowering. **They have taught me to approach divination with an open mind and warm heart.**” -B.L.

“Jamie’s Friday afternoon group tarot readings [in our office] are healing—a regular practice of pause, reflection, and experimentation. The sessions give me an opportunity for introspection, a suggestion to try on a perspective. And Jamie manages to create this space of sharing in our office; while I love my coworkers, it’s still an office, and the environment is not easily transformed....Jamie is wont to bring in small references to their own tarot practice that make you feel as though you are practicing WITH them....They are endlessly accessible, never failing to check in on what you’re taking away. **Jamie never imposes any kind of understanding; instead of providing answers, they tell a story that leads you to ask the right questions of yourself.**” -A.A.
